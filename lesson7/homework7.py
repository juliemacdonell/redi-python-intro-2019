Homework 7

In this exercise you will sort three numbers given to you by a user
and return them in an increasing order.
"""

# 7.A
# First you need to get the numbers from the user:
# (remembering to cast them to a number!)

number1 = 'fix me'  # get input from the user
number2 = 'fix me'  # get input from the user
number3 = 'fix me'  # get input from the user

# Now it is time to compare the numbers
# Use nested if conditions to figure out
# which number is the smallest, the biggest, etc.
# Assign the values of variables number1-3 to new variables:

smallest = 'fix me'
middle = 'fix me'
biggest = 'fix me'

# Use formatted string with {smallest}, {middle}, {biggest}
# to print the results
print(f'')

# 7.B
# There are faster ways of achieving the same results!
# Make a list that contains the numbers1-3
# and use one of the methods we learned to order the numbers.

my_list = 'fix me'  # create a list here

# Use formatted string with {my_list} to print the result
print(f'')
