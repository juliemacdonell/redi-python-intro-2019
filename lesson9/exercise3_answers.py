Exercise 3

Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.

Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Hints:
- The variables `x` and `y` have been initialized for you.
- Use a while loop to check the value of y
- Use the block within the while loop to change the values of `x` and `y`
  with each iteration
"""
x = 0
y = 1
