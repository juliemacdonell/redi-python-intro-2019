print(f'Welcome to my temperature converter!')

# Task 1: Ask the user what temperature they would like to convert.
# Hint: Save this to a variable and be careful with types.
a = input('What temperatue will you like to convert? ')
var = a

# Task 2: Ask the user which temperature scale they would like their
# temperature converted to?
# Hint: Save the answer to a variable.
b = input('Which temperature scale will you like to convert? ')
var = b

valid_temperature_scales = ('Fahrenheit', 'F', 'Celsius', 'C')
# Task 3: Using a while loop, check whether the desired temperature is in
# among the `valid_temperature_scales` defined above. If it is not, then the
# program should enter into the while loop execution block and prompt the
# user to provide again the desired temperature scale until a valid was is
# given by the user. Perhaps you might also want to print out some helpful
# information to the user, so as letting them know they did not choose a
# valid scale and which scales are valid.

# Task 4: Print back to the user what you plan to do with their request, i.e.
# 'Okay, I will convert 45 Celsius to Fahrenheit for you'


# Task 5: Calculate the converted temperature. You can easily find these
# questions online if you are stuck.


# Task 6: Print the results to your user.


# Task 7: Use your Celsius to Fahrenheit equation and a for loop to print
# the conversions of Celsius to Fahrenheit for Celsius values -10 to 30.
# Hint: Your for loop should use the `range` function.a
